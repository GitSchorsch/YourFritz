# C# classes for common tasks while working with FRITZ!Box devices

This folder contains work-in-progress files supporting various tasks in connection with FRITZ!OS based devices.

These tasks include:

- find a starting FRITZ!Box device in the local network
- access the FTP server in EVA bootloaders
- handle TFFS images
- sign firmware images and check signatures
- modify SquashFS images
- access a FRITZ!Box using GUI
- access a FRITZ!Box using TR-064
