The files in this folder are NOT licensed under GPL yet.

The files are incomplete and "work in progress" and you may let
you (possibly) inspire by them for an own solution.

But you're not allowed to copy, modify or distribute any file
from this folder. The only exceptions are the usual I/O operations
on a git repository and any actions needed to view file content.

If any file is complete enough in my opinion to be used by others,
I myself will provide it outside of this folder, where - at the same
time - other licenses will be granted (look for LICENSE files at
those other places).
